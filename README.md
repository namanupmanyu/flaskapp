Understanding the Concept of Microservices using AWS
In this project, we will explore the architecture and implementation of microservices using a Flask application deployed on AWS. Microservices architecture enables the development of applications as a collection of loosely coupled services, each focused on a specific business functionality. This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.
